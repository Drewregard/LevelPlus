# levelplus

Level+ is meant to bring a simple leveling system that makes your character progress as the game progresses.

Play expert mode or higher for an added challenge of enemies becoming stronger as your level gets higher.

For every enemy you kill, you will gain experience. Killing stronger enemies will give you more.
Leveling up increases your health and mana slightly, and gives you skill points.
You can invest skill points in Level+ stats to increase your character's power further.

You can reset your Level+ progress by crafting the Insignia of Rebirth near a wood workbench.
When you reach hardmode, you can get your points back and spend them differently by crafting the Insignia of Reform at a mythril anvil, using:
1 soul of light or night,
1 soul of flight,
and 1 gold or platinum bar.
